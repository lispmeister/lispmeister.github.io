<p>We've been asked if we can build something similar to this hydrophone array system but with higher resolution. The system described uses 47 hydrophones for cross sectional recordings of echolocation beams. I'm thinking that a version that works outside the aquarium environment and can be used from a boat would be even more interesting.</p>
